### 二、删除文件

1. 直接删除文件或使用命令rm readme.txt

2. git status

   - 结果：

     ```xml
     On branch master
     Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
     
     Changes not staged for commit:
       (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
       (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
     
             deleted:    README.txt
     
     no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
     ```

3. git commit -a -m "delete readme.txt"

   - 从版本库中彻底删掉了此文件

4. git status

   - 结果：

     ```xml
     On branch master
     Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
       (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
     
     nothing to commit, working tree clean
     ```
